# LoginSystem
I have been learning Java at school and my school was not teaching us interesting stuff so I decided to look up a tutorial that will boost my excitement for java. So I found this little project for creating a login system on youtube and I enjoy everything in the tutorial. I hope I will get better on my java and I will be going more java projects

the next project I will be going is creating is a car sales system.
